# boardgame_ratings

we will to explore the BoardGameGeek dataset. Using machine learning, we intend to predict what rating a board game should have on the BGG website (on a scale of 1-10) based on factors such as type, name, playtime, categories, total_comments, total_wants, etc. To achieve this we will also be using Pandas, sklearn, tensorflow, Plotly.js, SQL, and HTML/CSS/Bootstrap.
